                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

                <p>THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET
                    ACCESS TO THIS MEDICAL INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.</p>

                <p><strong>USE AND DISCLOSURE OF HEALTH INFORMATION</strong></p>

                <p>The company may use your health information, information that constitutes protected health
                    information as defined in the Privacy Rule of the Administrative Simplification provisions of the
                    Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, for purposes of providing you
                    treatment, obtaining payment for your care and conducting health care operations without consent.
                    Your health information may be used or disclosed for other purposes, except when legally required,
                    only after the company has obtained an authorization. The company has established policies to guard
                    against unnecessary disclosure of your health information.</p>

                <p>THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH AND PURPOSES FOR WHICH YOUR HEALTH
                    INFORMATION MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED FOR TREATMENT, PAYMENT AND HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS:</p>

                <p><strong>To Provide Treatment.&nbsp;</strong>The Company may use your health information to coordinate
                    care within the company and with others involved in your care, such as your physician, a home health
                    agency, a rehabilitation clinic, a laboratory and other health care professionals who have agreed to
                    assist the Company in coordinating care. For example, physicians involved in your care will need
                    information about your symptoms in order to prescribe appropriate medications. The Company also may
                    disclose your health care information to individuals outside of the Company involved in your care
                    including family members, pharmacists, suppliers of medical equipment or other health care
                    professionals.</p>

                <p><strong>To Obtain Payment.&nbsp;</strong>The Company may include your health information in invoices
                    to collect payment from third parties for the care you receive from the Company. For example, the
                    Company may be required by your health insurer to provide information regarding your health care
                    status so that the insurer will reimburse you or the Company. The Company also may need to obtain
                    prior approval from your insurer and may need to explain to the insurer your need for the healthcare
                    services that will be provided to you.</p>

                <p><strong>To Conduct Health Care Operations.</strong>&nbsp;The Company may use and disclose health
                    information for its own operations in order to facilitate the function of the Company and as
                    necessary to provide quality care to all of the Company‘s patients. Health care operations includes
                    such activities as:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Quality assessment and improvement activities.</li>
                    <li>Activities designed to improve outcomes or reduce health care costs.</li>
                    <li>Protocol development, case management and care coordination.</li>
                    <li>Contacting health care providers and patients with information about treatments alternatives and
                        other related functions that do not include treatment.</li>
                    <li>Business associates that perform various activities such as transcription services.</li>
                    <li>Professional review and performance evaluation.</li>
                    <li>Training programs including those in which students, trainees or practitioners in health care
                        learn under supervision.</li>
                    <li>Training of non-health care professionals.</li>
                    <li>Accreditation, certification, licensing or credentialing activities.</li>
                    <li>Review and auditing, including compliance reviews, medical reviews, legal services and
                        compliance programs.</li>
                    <li>Business planning and development including cost management and planning related analyses and
                        formulary development.</li>
                    <li>Business management and general administrative activities of the Company.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>For example the Company may use your health information to evaluate its staff performance, combine
                    your health information with other Company patients in evaluating how to more effectively serve all
                    Company patients, disclose your health information to Company staff and contracted personnel for
                    training purposes, use your health information to contact you as a reminder regarding a visit to
                    you, or contact you as part of community information mailings (unless you tell us you do not want to
                    be contacted).</p>

                <p><strong>For Fundraising and Marketing Activities.</strong>&nbsp;It is currently the company’s policy
                    not to disclose protected health information for fundraising or marketing purposes.</p>

                <p><strong>For Appointment Reminders.</strong>&nbsp;The Company may use and disclose your health
                    information to contact you as a reminder that you have an appointment for a home visit.</p>

                <p><strong>For Treatment Alternatives.&nbsp;</strong>The Company may use and disclose your health
                    information to tell you about or recommend possible treatment options or alternatives that may be of
                    interest to you.</p>

                <p><strong>THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH AND PURPOSES FOR WHICH YOUR
                        HEALTH INFORMATION MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED WITHOUT FIRST RECEIVING YOUR WRITTEN
                        CONSENT</strong></p>

                <p><strong>When Legally Required.&nbsp;</strong>The Company will disclose your health information when
                    it is required to do so by any Federal, State or local law.</p>

                <p><strong>When There Are Risks to Public Health.</strong>&nbsp;The Company may disclose your health
                    information for public activities and purposes in order to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Prevent or control disease, injury or disability, report disease, injury, vital events such as
                        birth or death and the conduct of public health surveillance, investigations and interventions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Report adverse events, product defects, to track products or enable product recalls, repairs and
                        replacements and to conduct post-marketing surveillance and compliance with requirements of the
                        Food and Drug Administration.</li>
                    <li>Notify a person who has been exposed to a communicable disease or who may be at risk of
                        contracting or spreading a disease.</li>
                    <li>Notify an employer about an individual who is a member of the workforce as legally required.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>To Report Abuse, Neglect Or Domestic Violence.</strong>&nbsp;The Company is allowed to notify
                    government authorities if the Company believes a patient is the victim of abuse, neglect or domestic
                    violence. The Company will make this disclosure only when specifically required or authorized by law
                    or when the patient agrees to the disclosure.</p>

                <p><strong>To Conduct Health Oversight Activities.&nbsp;</strong>The Company may disclose your health
                    information to a health oversight Company for activities including audits, civil administrative or
                    criminal investigations, inspections, licensure or disciplinary action. The Company, however, may
                    not disclose your health information if you are the subject of an investigation and your health
                    information is not directly related to your receipt of health care or public benefits.</p>

                <p><strong>In Connection With Judicial And Administrative Proceedings.&nbsp;</strong>The Company may
                    disclose your health information in the course of any judicial or administrative proceeding in
                    response to an order of a court or administrative tribunal as expressly authorized by such order or
                    in response to a subpoena, discovery request or other lawful process, but only when the Company
                    makes reasonable efforts to either notify you about the request or to obtain an order protecting
                    your health information.</p>

                <p><strong>For Law Enforcement Purposes.</strong>&nbsp;As permitted or required by State law, the
                    Company may disclose your health information to a law enforcement official for certain law
                    enforcement purposes as follows:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>As required by law for reporting of certain types of wounds or other physical injuries pursuant
                        to the court order, warrant, subpoena or summons or similar process.</li>
                    <li>For the purpose of identifying or locating a suspect, fugitive, material witness or missing
                        person.</li>
                    <li>Under certain limited circumstances, when you are the victim of a crime.</li>
                    <li>To a law enforcement official if the Company has a suspicion that your death was the result of

                    <li>In an emergency in order to report a crime.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>To Coroners And Medical Examiners.&nbsp;</strong>The Company may disclose your health
                    information to coroners and medical examiners for purposes of determining your cause of death or for

                <p><strong>For Research Purposes.&nbsp;</strong>The Company may, under very select circumstances, use
                    your health information for research. Before the Company discloses any of your health information
                    for such research purposes, the project will be subject to an extensive approval process. The
                    Company will almost always request your written authorization before granting access to your
                    individually identifiable health information.</p>

                <p><strong>In the Event of A Serious Threat To Health Or Safety.&nbsp;</strong>The Company may,
                    consistent with applicable law and ethical standards of conduct, disclose your health information if
                    the Company, in good faith, believes that such disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a
                    serious and imminent threat to your health or safety or to the health and safety of the public.</p>

                <p><strong>For Specified Government Functions.</strong>&nbsp;In certain circumstances, the Federal
                    regulations authorize the Company to use or disclose your health information to facilitate specified

                <p><strong>For Worker’s Compensation.</strong>&nbsp;The Company may release your health information for
